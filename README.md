[Reflection]

In our first week of project development, our team made significant strides, although we encountered several challenges that have pointed the way to areas for improvement. Our initial discussions led us to establish the project's overall scope and objectives, providing us with a foundational understanding. A crucial decision was made to target the elderly as our primary audience, shaping the project's design and development strategies. While we briefly touched upon OCBC features, a more in-depth exploration is required to harness these tools effectively to benefit the elderly.

Individually, I took on the task of researching the reasons why the elderly might be hesitant to adopt technology. This research is pivotal for addressing the pain points and challenges our project aims to overcome. Nevertheless, it presented challenges in the early stages due to a lack of a clear starting point.

Our team's communication and preparedness saw some success as we defined key project parameters and identified our target audience. However, we realized that we didn't delve deep enough into understanding OCBC features, a critical aspect for the project's success. It is imperative that we conduct more comprehensive research in this area.

To enhance our productivity, it is essential for every team member to come to meetings well-prepared. This includes extensive research on OCBC features to gain a profound understanding of the tools at our disposal. Moreover, we must establish clear communication channels, define roles and responsibilities, and set clear timelines and milestones to avoid feeling overwhelmed by the project's scope.

Emotionally, I experienced confusion and anxiety during this first week, primarily due to the initial challenges we faced. However, I acknowledge that these emotions are part of the project development process. With better planning, communication, and a structured timeline, I am confident that our team can overcome these initial hurdles and make substantial progress in the coming weeks. Challenges are inherent in any project, but addressing them head-on can transform them into opportunities for growth and success.

[Reflection]

At week 2, our project team demonstrated a commendable commitment to addressing the needs of the elderly with a specific focus on those with illiteracy, which is a significant accomplishment. Despite the challenges we faced, particularly in the slow progress of developing the outframe of our project, we managed to maintain all our Scrum events within the designated timeframes, showcasing our dedication to an efficient workflow. However, it's evident that our planning and resource allocation could have been more meticulous, as the development of the database structure proved more complex than anticipated. Moving forward, we should prioritize in-depth planning and early resource allocation to avoid similar delays. As we enter Week 3, I'm both motivated by our team's commitment and slightly concerned about the need to pick up the pace in certain areas. Nevertheless, these emotions serve as catalysts for our continuous improvement, and I have full confidence that we can overcome challenges and make steady progress towards our project's goals.
