[Reflection]

In our first week of project development, our team made significant strides, although we encountered several challenges that have pointed the way to areas for improvement. Our initial discussions led us to establish the project's overall scope and objectives, providing us with a foundational understanding. A crucial decision was made to target the elderly as our primary audience, shaping the project's design and development strategies. While we briefly touched upon OCBC features, a more in-depth exploration is required to harness these tools effectively to benefit the elderly.

Individually, I took on the task of researching the reasons why the elderly might be hesitant to adopt technology. This research is pivotal for addressing the pain points and challenges our project aims to overcome. Nevertheless, it presented challenges in the early stages due to a lack of a clear starting point.

Our team's communication and preparedness saw some success as we defined key project parameters and identified our target audience. However, we realized that we didn't delve deep enough into understanding OCBC features, a critical aspect for the project's success. It is imperative that we conduct more comprehensive research in this area.

To enhance our productivity, it is essential for every team member to come to meetings well-prepared. This includes extensive research on OCBC features to gain a profound understanding of the tools at our disposal. Moreover, we must establish clear communication channels, define roles and responsibilities, and set clear timelines and milestones to avoid feeling overwhelmed by the project's scope.

Emotionally, I experienced confusion and anxiety during this first week, primarily due to the initial challenges we faced. However, I acknowledge that these emotions are part of the project development process. With better planning, communication, and a structured timeline, I am confident that our team can overcome these initial hurdles and make substantial progress in the coming weeks. Challenges are inherent in any project, but addressing them head-on can transform them into opportunities for growth and success.

[Reflection]

At week 2, our project team demonstrated a commendable commitment to addressing the needs of the elderly with a specific focus on those with illiteracy, which is a significant accomplishment. Despite the challenges we faced, particularly in the slow progress of developing the outframe of our project, we managed to maintain all our Scrum events within the designated timeframes, showcasing our dedication to an efficient workflow. However, it's evident that our planning and resource allocation could have been more meticulous, as the development of the database structure proved more complex than anticipated. Moving forward, we should prioritize in-depth planning and early resource allocation to avoid similar delays. As we enter Week 3, I'm both motivated by our team's commitment and slightly concerned about the need to pick up the pace in certain areas. Nevertheless, these emotions serve as catalysts for our continuous improvement, and I have full confidence that we can overcome challenges and make steady progress towards our project's goals.

[Reflection]

Reflecting on our project to build a website aimed at the elderly audience with a focus on OCBC's 2nd Party Guarantor feature, there have been both successes and challenges that have emerged during our journey.

One of the positive aspects that stand out is the progress we have made. Each member of our team has contributed to the project's development in significant ways. From designing the front-end to creating the database and developing the back-end model, we have managed to lay a solid foundation for our website. This demonstrates the diverse skill set within our team and our commitment to delivering a high-quality product.

However, there are areas where we have encountered challenges. It's evident that we need to increase our efficiency and the pace of project development. As we move forward, finding ways to streamline our processes and optimize our workflows will be essential. Regularly assessing our progress, identifying bottlenecks, and implementing improvements will be crucial to meet our project goals.

In terms of improvement, it's clear that better communication and collaboration can significantly benefit our team. Making constant updates with each other will help keep everyone on the same page, ensure alignment with the project's objectives, and minimize misunderstandings. This will contribute to increased efficiency and effectiveness in our development process.

In the midst of these challenges and opportunities for improvement, my feelings remain ambitious, happy, and hopeful. Our project is a reflection of our team's aspirations and the potential to make a positive impact on our target audience. While there may be hurdles to overcome, I'm confident that with dedication, improved communication, and a shared vision, we can achieve our goals and create a website that benefits the elderly while showcasing the OCBC 2nd Party Guarantor feature.

As we continue our work, let's carry our ambition and hope forward, addressing challenges with a proactive mindset and maintaining the happiness that comes from contributing to a project that has the potential to make a real difference.

[Reflection]
n Week 15, our group centered its efforts on tailoring our project to cater to the needs of our target audience—the illiterate elderly. Our focus remained on refining our approach to accommodate the unique requirements of this demographic. Collaboratively, we engaged in ideation and task distribution for the upcoming sprint, fostering a sense of unity within the team. I actively participated in group discussions, contributing valuable insights and ideas. This collaborative effort significantly influenced the steady progress we achieved in understanding our target audience and adjusting our project accordingly. On a personal level, I take pride in the consistent progress on my individual tasks. The dynamics during our regular meetings proved effective, promoting constructive discussions and facilitating decision-making within the team. However, challenges emerged, particularly with responsive design issues for certain website elements. Integrating individual contributions revealed unforeseen complexities, resulting in hurdles in our progress. Reflecting on our experiences, communication regarding task dependencies could have been more explicit, leading to delays and hindering the seamless integration of our work. Implementing a more detailed task management system may mitigate such issues in the future. To address the responsive design challenges, organizing a brief training session could benefit the team collectively. Proactively equipping ourselves with these skills would enhance our ability to address similar issues more efficiently in subsequent sprints. Emotionally, I find myself navigating a mix of anxiety, hope, and optimism. Despite challenges, the hope arises from addressing communication gaps and planning relevant training. The team's enthusiasm and dedication foster optimism, reinforcing my belief in our collective ability to navigate challenges successfully. As we move into the next sprint, I am optimistic that the lessons learned this week will contribute to a more streamlined and effective workflow, ultimately leading to the success of our project.
